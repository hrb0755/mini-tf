Fused operators combine multiple individual operations (such as matrix multiplication and layer normalization) into a single operation to reduce computational overhead (less access to memory for loading in data/weights or storing intermediate results). A fused operator allows multiple operations to be executed together in one pass, which reduces memory usage and possibly avoids redundant computations, leading to faster execution. They may also be compiled to run faster, better leveraging the SIMD capabilities of the hardware For this PA specifically, as the parallelism is largely non-existent, fusing opeators mostly save time from  setting up a function's execution context, memory reads and writes between subsequent calls, and argument passing.

As for optimization, we could consider storing intermediate results for this PA to avoid recomputing of some nodes. More generally, we could strategically fuse more operations together, should they occur together frequently enough. GPUs or other accelerator could also integrate designated fused operation hardware to maximize efficency. Better memory management strategies (like caching and tiling) could also help fused operations (and non-fused ones also).
